# Simple python script to generate numbers from 1 to 100
# But on multiples of three print "Loktar" instead of the number, 
# and on multiples of five print "Ogar". 
# and on multiples of both 3 and 5 your program should print "LoktarOgar".

        print(x,'= LoktarOgar')
    # check if the value can be divided by 3
    elif x % 3 == 0:
